# Song Shine

A simple app for managing and presenting your song texts.

Demo: https://song-shine.herokuapp.com

## TODOs

This app is work-in-progress and thus most functionality hasn't been implemented, yet. These steps will follow:

- Unit and snapshot tests with jest
- Prop type definitions
- Search
- Add and delete songs and artists (editing already works)
- Show artist and song details
- Song presentation (verse by verse full-screen display)
- Background management for storing pictures and videos to use during the song presentation
- Settings dialog (speed, transitions, etc.)
- Documentation
- Unique design
